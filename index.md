I am a seventh year PhD student in the Biophysics Graduate Group at UC Berkeley. My advisors are [Michael I. Jordan](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/) and [Michael R. DeWeese](https://deweeselab.com/). I am affiliated with the Statistical AI Learning group and the [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) group. I am interested in theoretical machine learning and in the interface of computer science and statistics with physics.

In the summer of 2019 I interned at Google Brain, where I was hosted by [Jascha Sohl-Dickstein](http://www.sohldickstein.com/). I am grateful to have been supported by a Google PhD Fellowship in the past (2018-21).

Before I came to Berkeley, I was a Junior Research Fellow at the National Center for Biological Sciences in Bangalore, India. Before that, I completed a Masters degree in theoretical physics at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada. I was an undergraduate at Amherst College, where I received a degree in physics.
