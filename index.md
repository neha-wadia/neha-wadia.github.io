I am a final year PhD student at UC Berkeley. 
I am interested in theoretical machine learning and in the interface of physics with computer science and statistics.
My advisors are [Michael I. Jordan](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/) and [Michael R. DeWeese](https://deweeselab.com/).
I am affiliated with the Statistical AI Learning group, the [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) group, and the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu).

In the summer of 2019 I interned at Google Brain, where I was hosted by [Jascha Sohl-Dickstein](http://www.sohldickstein.com/). During the academic years 2018-21, I was supported by a Google PhD Fellowship.

Before I came to Berkeley, I was a Junior Research Fellow at the National Center for Biological Sciences in Bangalore, India. Before that, I completed a Masters degree in theoretical physics at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada. I was an undergraduate at Amherst College, where I received a degree in physics.
