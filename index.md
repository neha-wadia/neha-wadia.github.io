I am a sixth year PhD student in the Biophysics Graduate Group at UC Berkeley. My advisors are Michael I. Jordan and Michael R. DeWeese. I am affiliated with the Statistical AI Learning group. I am interested in theoretical machine learning and in the interface of computer science and statistics with physics.

In the summer of 2019 I interned at Google Brain, where I was hosted by Jascha Sohl-Dickstein.

I am grateful to be supported by a Google PhD Fellowship.

Before I came to Berkeley, I was a Junior Research Fellow at the National Center for Biological Sciences in Bangalore, India. Before that, I completed a Masters degree in theoretical physics at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada. I was an undergraduate at Amherst College, where I received a degree in physics.
